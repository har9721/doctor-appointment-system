<The @extends directive in Blade is meant to extend a layout file, and it is processed before the view is rendered, which means it doesn't respect conditionals like @if. As a result, both components are being processed, regardless of the condition.Instead of using @extends for rendering components conditionally, you should use the @include directive, which is the correct way to include partial views or components in a Blade template.
